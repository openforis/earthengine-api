Suppose you want to apply a computation to the pixels before obtaining the result.  This guide shows how to protoype a computation with one of the client libraries, serialize the computation graph and use the REST API to obtain the computed result.  This corresponds to a `POST` request to one of the compute endpoints, for example [`computePixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.image/computePixels), [`computeFeatures`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.table/computeFeatures) or the generic [`value.compute`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1alpha/projects.value/compute).
